3) IR step


36 to 88: 86
37 to 84: 78 


issue: note.end = min(note.end, starts[si+1])

the note should not end when the next one starts if the next note is of lower pitch.

fix: 
keep a list of current notes and hash the largest value of this list and also the end times so that we are able to remove them as we see fit.


new ideas:
can use velocity and pitch together for that weight of the vector (skyline uses just pitch and NELODY INDENTIFICATION I STANDARD MIDI uses velocity (a cited paper in intro atleast))
