1) preprocessing 
2) melody extract skyline explain
3) IR step


36 to 88: 86
37 to 84: 78 


issue: note.end = min(note.end, starts[si+1])

the note should not end when the next one starts if the next note is of lower pitch.

fix: 
keep a list of current notes and hash the largest value of this list and also the end times so that we are able to remove them as we see fit.


new ideas:
can use velocity and pitch together for that weight of the vector (skyline uses just pitch and NELODY INDENTIFICATION I STANDARD MIDI uses velocity (a cited paper in intro atleast))




ISSUE NEW #1:
We need to change VSM since VSM has no ordering. Like use a new IR technique.

ISSUE NEW #2:
We can add the velocity in the VSM embedding too! So it will become pitch,velocity as the vector with the weights as the time of that combination.

ISSUE NEW #3:
When reading file, we will clip pitch to -128 to 128 OR just ingore notes with high pitches.
